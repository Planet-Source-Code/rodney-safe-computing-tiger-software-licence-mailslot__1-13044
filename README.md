## Licence Mailslot


</div>

### Description

This program is an advance Edition of the mailslot program I posted ealier.

Now this sample will protect your software of beiing running more than the maximum user licence your software allowed.

Any one connected to the network will not be able to run your application if they exits the maximum user licence allowed by your application.

Offcourse you've to defind how many users are allowed to run your application at the same time.

When start it will looks over the network if thera are any copy running. If found it will count the Computer name as a user. If at final the maximum user count >= than MaxUser License permitted. Program will Quit.

I prevent the program of running twice on the same machine by including the command App.PrevInstance at formload.

This command only works when the program is compiled as an executable.

In Design mode you can run the program twice.

This program is well commented.

Take a look VOTE and have fun.

Rodney Godfried.
